# change-github-challenge

This guide is intended to get everyone familiar with using git and github, as well as simulating how this technology is typically used within Change++.


If this is your first time working with git, check out [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D89Tvytivgpwm0VHu8-KRdGXipxD7ze28uD_goA2j88/edit) we made to help get you up to speed!

To give a quick overview: you're going to be cloning this repo to your computer, creating your own branch, changing a text file, pushing that branch and creating a pull request for it on github. Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes; let's get started.

## 1. Clone the repository to your computer

Open up terminal or command line and navigate to wherever you plan to place this repo. Copy and paste this code and press enter:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jdnhix/change-github-challenge.git
```

Now your computer has a local version of the code.

## 2. Create a new branch

Now we want to create a new branch for your work. We do this so that the work you do on your branch doesn't accidentally mess up anyone else's work. You can run this command to see all the current branches:

```bash
$ git branch
```

Back in your terminal, run this command with your name replaced to create your own branch:

```bash
$ git branch <firstname-lastname>
```

Try running "git branch" again to see if you can see your new branch. To switch to your new branch, run:

```bash
$ git checkout <branchname>
```

## 3. Edit the text document

### CHANGE WHAT I WANT THEM TO DO HERE!!

## 4. Push to GitHub
Now, without going back to the master branch, send your changes back to the repo. If you're unfamiliar, this will require a git add, commit, and push.

## 5. Create a pull request for your branch
Now that your branch and changes are in the repo
